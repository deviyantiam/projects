This repo contains several projects that I made in early 2019, while I tried to make career transition to Data Scientist. The code were messy and my coding skill is way better now as time progresses.
The following are the project list:
- news recommendation
- sentiment analysis and product recommendation using nearest neighbor
- movie recommendation using item-based and user-based
- rfm segmentation
